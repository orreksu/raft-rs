<h2>CS 3700 - Networks and Distributed Systems</h2>
<h3>Project 5: Distributed, Replicated Key-Value Store</h3>
<p>
<h3>Description</h3>
In his project, you will build a (relatively) simple, distributed, replicated key-value datastore. A key-value
datastore is a very simple type of database that supports two API calls from clients: <i>put(key, value)</i>
and <i>get(key)</i>. The former API allows a client application to store a key-value pair in the database,
while the latter API allows a client to retrieve a previously stored value by supplying its key. Real-world examples of distributed key-value datastores include memcached,
Redis, DynamoDB, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, it would be simple to build a key-value store if it was a single process. However, your system must be replicated
    and support strong consistency guarantees. Thus, you will be implementing a simplified version of the <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">Raft</a>    consensus protocol. Your datastore will be run multiple times, in parallel, and it will use the Raft protocol to maintain
    consensus among the replicas.
</p>
<p>
    Your datastore will be tested for both correctness and performance. We will provide a testbed for your datastore that will
    simulate clients who execute <i>put()</i> and <i>get()</i> commands, as well as an unreliable network that can drop
    packets or make hosts unavailable. Part of your grade will come from the overhead your system has (i.e., fewer packets
    will result in a higher score), while another part will depend on the speed at which your datastore answers client queries
    (i.e. what is the query latency). Your results will be compared to your classmates' via a leaderboard.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Language and Libraries</h3>
    You may write your code in whatever language you choose, as long as your code compiles and runs on <b>unmodified</b>    Khoury College Linux machines <b>on the command line</b>. Do not use libraries that are not installed by default on the Khoury College Linux
    machines. Similarly, your code must compile and run on the command line. You may use IDEs (e.g. Eclipse) during development,
    but do not turn in your IDE project without a Makefile. Make sure you code has <b>no dependencies</b> on your IDE.
</p>
<p>
    You may not use libraries or modules that implement consensus protocols. This includes any library that implements Raft,
    Paxos, Replicated View-state, or similar protocols. Obviously, you cannot use any libraries or software packages that
    implement a replicated key-value datastore. For example, your program cannot be a thin wrapper around memcached, etc.
    You may use libraries or modules that implement local database storage (e.g. SQLite, BerkeleyDB, LevelDB) if you want
    to use them for persistent storage within each replica. If you have any questions about whether a particular library
    or module is allowed, post on Piazza.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Your Program</h3>
    For this project, you will submit one program named <b>3700kvstore</b> that implements the replicated datastore. You
    may use any language of your choice, and we will give you basic starter code in Python. Keep in mind that you are writing
    a program that will be run multiple times, in parallel, to form a distributed system.
</p>
<p>
    If you use C or any other compiled language, your executable should be named 3700kvstore. If you use an interpreted language,
    your script must be called 3700kvstore, must include a shebang, and be marked as executable. If you use a virtual machine-based language (like
    Java or C#), you must write a brief Bash shell script, named 3700kvstore, that conforms to the input syntax given below
    and then launches your program using whatever incantations are necessary. For example, if you write your solution in
    Java, your Bash script might resemble
    <pre>#!/usr/bin/perl -w
$args = join(' ', @ARGV);
print 'java -jar 3700kvstore.jar $args';</pre>
    Or, if you use python, your script might start with
    <pre>#!/usr/bin/python
import foo from bar</pre>
    and should be marked executable.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Starter Code</h3>
    Very basic starter code for the assignment in Python, as well as the testbed scripts, are available <a href="../archive/proj5.tgz">here</a>
</p>
<p>
    The starter code provides a bare-bones implementation of a datastore that simply connects to the LAN and broadcasts a "no-op"
    message once every second. You may use this code as a basis for your project if you wish, but it is strongly recommended
    that you do not do so unless you are comfortable with Python.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Testing Your Code</h3>
    In order to evaluate your replicated datastore, we have provided a simulated test environment. The simulator will create
    an emulated network and all necessary sockets, execute several copies of your datastore with the appropriate command
    line arguments, route messages between the datastore replicas, and generate requests from clients. This script is included
    in the starter code, and you can run it by executing
    <pre>./run.py &lt;config-file&gt;</pre>
    where &lt;config-file&gt; is the configuration file that describes the test configuration you would like to use. Note that
    you will not need to modify the run script, or parse the config files (the run script parses the config files). You may
    create custom configs to test your code under different scenarios if you want to.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Config File Format</h3>
    The configuration file that you pass to ./run.py contains a number of parameters that control the simulation. The file is
    formatted in JSON and has the following elements
    <ul>
        <li>lifetime (Required) The number of seconds the simulation should run for. Must be at least 5.</li>
        <li>replicas (Required) The number of replicas to execute, i.e. copies of your 3700kvstore program. Must be at least
            3.</li>
        <li>requests (Required) The number of get() and put() requests to randomly generate from clients.</li>
        <li>mix (Optional) Float between 0 and 1 representing the fraction of client queries that are get()s. Defaults to 0.8.</li>
        <li>wait (Optional) The number of seconds to wait before sending any client requests. Defaults to 2 seconds.</li>
        <li>end_wait (Optional) The number of seconds to wait at the end of the simulation before measuring performance. Defaults to 2 seconds.</li>
        <li>seed (Optional) The random seed to choose. If not specified, a random value is chosen. Setting this value will allow
            for a semi-reproducible set of clients and requests.</li>
        <li>drops (Optional) Float between 0 and 1 representing the fraction of messages between replicas to drop. Defaults to
            0.</li>
        <li>events (Optional) A list of events that will occur during the simulation. Each event has a type and a time when it
            will trigger:
            <ul>
                <li>type (Required) The type of event. Valid types are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>kill_non_leader: will crash fail a random non-leader replica</li>
                        <li>kill_leader: will crash fail the current leader.</li>
                        <li>part_easy: partition the network, such that the leader has a quorum</li>
                        <li>part_hard: partition the network, such that the leader does not have a quorum</li>
                        <li>part_end: remove all network partitions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>time (Required) The timestamp, in seconds, when the event should occur.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>tests (Required) Information about how to test the replicas for performance and correctness:
                <ul>
                    <li>maximum_get_fail_fraction (Optional) Float between 0 and 1 specifying the maximum fraction of get() requests that may fail. Defaults to 0.5.</li>
                    <li>maximum_put_fail_fraction (Optional) Float between 0 and 1 specifying the maximum fraction of put() requests that may fail. Defaults to 0.5.</li>
                    <li>maximum_get_generation_fail_fraction (Optional) Float between 0 and 1 specifying the maximum fraction of get() requests that may fail to be generated (due to insufficient put() requests succeeding). Defaults to 0.1.</li>
                    <li>maximum_appends_batched_fraction (Optional) Float between 0 and 1 specifying the maximum fraction of append messages that may be batched together. Defaults to 0.5.</li>
                    <li>benchmarks (Required) Sets thresholds across four categories for assessing the performance of the replicas. In each category, three thresholds are specified, which separate the extra credit, full credit, partial credit, and no credit performance ranges:
                        <ul>
                            <li>total_msgs: how many total messages were sent between the replicas (lower is better)?</li>
                            <li>failures: how many fail messages were sent to clients AND how many client queries were unanswered (lower is better)?</li>
                            <li>duplicates: how many duplicate responses were returned to clients (e.g. the same get() or put() was answered more than once) (lower is better)?</li>
                            <li>median_latency: median latency of answering client requests (lower is better)</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    For example, a simple configuration with no events and a read-heavy workload might look like the following
    <pre>{
    "lifetime": 30,
    "replicas": 5,
    "requests": 500,
    "mix": 0.9,
    "tests" : {
        "benchmarks" : {
            "total_msgs"     : [1200, 3000, 5000],
            "failures"       : [0, 1, 2],
            "duplicates"     : [0, 2, 5],
            "median_latency" : [0.0004, 0.002, 0.05]
        }
    }
}</pre>
    and a more complex configuration with events and a lossy network might be
    <pre>{
    "lifetime": 30,
    "replicas": 5,
    "requests": 300,
    "mix" : 0.2,
    "drops" : 0.15,
    "end_wait" : 5,
    "events" : [{"type": "kill_leader", "time": 8},
                {"type": "kill_leader", "time": 16}],
    "tests" : {
        "benchmarks" : {
            "total_msgs"     : [1000, 3000, 4000],
            "failures"       : [1, 10, 100],
            "duplicates"     : [0, 2, 10],
            "median_latency" : [0.00015, 0.005, 0.05]
        }
    }
}</pre>
</p>
<p>
    <h3>./run.py Output</h3>
    The ./run.py script will output any errors it encounters during the simulation, including malformed messages, messages to
    unknown destinations, replicas that unexpectedly quit, etc. Once the simulation completes, ./run.py prints (1) some statistics
    about your datastore's performance and behavior, (2) whether your datastore passed the correctness checks, and if not, why not, (3) how your datastore faired on the performance benchmarks. Note that performance is assessed only if the datastore passes the correctness checks.
</p>
<p>
    Here is an example of the simulator's output when a datastore fails the correctness checks:
    <pre>bash$ ./run.py config.json
...
# Simulation Finished

## Useful Information and Statistics
Leaders: FFFF 0001 FFFF 0003
Replicas that died/were killed: 0/2
Total messages sent: 6370
Total messages dropped: 183
Total client get()/put() requests: 60/40
Total duplicate responses: 3
Total unanswered get()/put() requests: 33/3
Total redirects: 19
Total get()/put() failures: 15/31
Total get() with incorrect response: 7

## Correctness Checks
    Error: >0 incorrect responses to get()
    Error: insufficient get() requests answered (33 > 60 * 0.50)

## Correctness Checks Failed, Skipping Performance Tests</pre>
Ideally, you would like all get() and put() requests to succeed without failing and for them to have low latency. Obviously,
if your system is returning incorrect values to get() requests then your datastore has consistency issues. Furthermore, you
would like the total number of packets to be as low as possible, i.e. the overhead of your datastore on the network should
be low.
</p>
<p>
    Here is another example when the correctness checks pass; notice the performance results are now printed:
    <pre>bash$ ./run.py config.json
...
# Simulation Finished
            
## Useful Information and Statistics
Leaders: FFFF 0001 FFFF 0003
Replicas that died/were killed: 0/2
Total messages sent: 6370
Total messages dropped: 183
Total client get()/put() requests: 60/40
Total duplicate responses: 3
Total unanswered get()/put() requests: 0/3
Total redirects: 19
Total get()/put() failures: 15/31
Total get() with incorrect response: 0
            
## Correctness Checks
    All correctness tests passed

## Performance Tests
## &lt;test metric&gt;: &lt;your score&gt; &lt;benchmark score&gt;, &lt;test result&gt;
    Total Messages Between Replicas: 6370 &gt;= 1000, Failed
    Total Failures and Unanswered Requests: 49 &lt; 60, Passed
    Duplicate Responses to Clients: 3 &lt; 4, Partial credit, needs improvement
    Median Response Latency to Clients: 0.0001 &lt; 0.0002, Bonus!</pre>
    In this case, the performance results of the datastore are mixed. This implementation has extremely low median latency and is earning bonus point, and the number of failures/unanswered requests is acceptable, but the datastore could be improved by sending fewer duplicate requests and many fewer messages overall.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Testing Script</h3>
    Additionally, we have included a basic test script that runs your code under a variety of different configurations. To run the test script, you can do so with
<pre>bash$ ./run.py test-whatever.json</pre>
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Message Format</h3>
    To simplify this project, instead of using real packet formats, we will be sending our data across the wire in JSON (many
    languages have utilities to encode and decode JSON, and you are welcome to use these libraries). All messages <b>must</b>    be encoded as a dictionary, and they <b>must</b> include the following four keys (at a minimum) :
    <ul>
        <li><i>src</i> - The ID of the source of the message.</li>
        <li><i>dst</i> - The ID of the destination of the message.</li>
        <li><i>leader</i> - The ID of the leader, or "FFFF" if the leader's ID is unknown.</li>
        <li><i>type</i> - The type of the message.</li>
    </ul>
    The simulator uses <i>src</i> and <i>dst</i> instead of IP addresses in order to route and deliver messages. Furthermore,
    the simulator supports multicast: if <i>dst</i> is set to "FFFF", the message will be delivered to all replicas (use
    multicast sparingly, since it is expensive). <i>leader</i> is the ID of the replica that the sender of the message believes
    is the leader. All messages must include the <i>leader</i> so that the simulator can learn which replica is the leader
    (otherwise, the simulator would have no way of determining this information).
</p>
<p>
    <i>type</i> describes the type of the message. You may define custom types in order to implement your datastore (and
    you may add custom keys to the message dictionary in these cases). However, there are several message types that your
    replicas <b>must</b> support in order to handle requests from clients.
    <ul>
        <li><i>get</i> - get() messages are read requests from clients. They have the following format:
            <pre>{"src": "&lt;ID&gt;", "dst": "&lt;ID&gt;", "leader": "&lt;ID&gt;", "type": "get", "MID": "&lt;a unique string&gt;",
"key": "&lt;some key&gt;"}</pre>
            Your replicas may respond with an OK message which include the corresponding value:
            <pre>{"src": "&lt;ID&gt;", "dst": "&lt;ID&gt;", "leader": "&lt;ID&gt;", "type": "ok", "MID": "&lt;a unique string&gt;",
"value": "&lt;value of the key&gt;"}</pre>
            Or your replicas may respond with a failure message, in which case the client will retry the get():
            <pre>{"src": "&lt;ID&gt;", "dst": "&lt;ID&gt;", "leader": "&lt;ID&gt;", "type": "fail", "MID": "&lt;a unique string&gt;"}</pre>
            If the client issues a get() for a key that has does not exist (i.e. it was never put()), your datastore should return an
            empty value (i.e. an empty string).
        </li>
        <li><i>put</i> - put() messages are write requests from clients. They have the following format:
            <pre>{"src": "&lt;ID&gt;", "dst": "&lt;ID&gt;", "leader": "&lt;ID&gt;", "type": "put", "MID": "&lt;a unique string&gt;",
"key": "&lt;some key&gt;", "value": "&lt;value of the key&gt;"}</pre>
            Your replicas may respond with an OK message if the write was successful:
            <pre>{"src": "&lt;ID&gt;", "dst": "&lt;ID&gt;", "leader": "&lt;ID&gt;", "type": "ok", "MID": "&lt;a unique string&gt;"}</pre>
            Or your replicas may respond with a failure message, in which case the client will retry the put():
            <pre>{"src": "&lt;ID&gt;", "dst": "&lt;ID&gt;", "leader": "&lt;ID&gt;", "type": "fail", "MID": "&lt;a unique string&gt;"}</pre>
        </li>
        <li><i>redirect</i> - If the client sends any message (get() or put()) to a replica that is not the leader, it should
            respond with a redirect:
            <pre>{"src": "&lt;ID&gt;", "dst": "&lt;ID&gt;", "leader": "&lt;ID&gt;", "type": "redirect", "MID": "&lt;a unique string&gt;"}</pre>
            In this case, the client will retry the request by sending it to the specified leader.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Note that in all of the above cases, the MID in a request must match the MID in the response. For example, the following
    would be a legal series of requests and responses, where 001A is a client and 0000 and 0001 are replicas:
<pre>Request 1     {"src": "001A", "dst": "0001", "leader": "FFFF",
                "type": "get", "MID": "4D61ACF83027", "key": "name"}
Response 1    {"src": "0001", "dst": "001A", "leader": "0000",
               "type": "redirect", "MID": "4D61ACF83027"}
	
Request 2     {"src": "001A", "dst": "0000", "leader": "0000",
               "type": "get", "MID": "9AB4CE50023", "key": "name"}
Response 2    {"src": "0000", "dst": "001A", "leader": "0000", "type": "ok",
               "MID": "9AB4CE50023", "value": "Christo Wilson"}</pre>
 Again, you will need to develop additional, custom message types in order to implement the Raft consensus protocol. As long
as your messages include the four minimum required fields (src, dst, leader, type), the simulator will ensure that your messages
are delivered.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Command Line Specification</h3>
    The command line syntax for your <i>3700kvstore</i> program is given below. The simulator will pass parameters to each
    replica representing (1) the ID of the replica, and (2) the IDs of all other replicas in the system. The syntax for launching
    your datastore is therefore:
    <pre>./3700kvstore &lt;your ID&gt; &lt;ID of second replica&gt; [ID3 [ID4 ...]]</pre>
    For simplicity, all replica IDs are unique four-digit hexadecimal numbers (e.g., 0AA1 or F29A). You will use these IDs as
    the
    <i>src</i> and <i>dst</i> in your messages. Clients will also be assigned unique IDs by the simulator.
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Connecting to the LAN</h3>
    We will be using UNIX domain sockets to emulate a LAN. Each of your replicas will connect to a single domain socket (the
    way a server would connect to a single Ethernet cable). A replica will send and receive all messages over this socket
    (i.e. messages to/from other replicas, as well as messages to/from clients). Your program should be constantly reading
    from the socket make sure it receives all messages (they will be buffered if you don't read immediately). The simulator
    will take care of routing all sent messages to the appropriate destinations; thus, it's okay if you're not intimately
    familiar with how Domain Sockets work, or with how the simulator works.
</p>
<p>
    Each replica should connect to a Domain Socket named "ID" (no-quotes), where ID is the replica's ID (i.e. the first ID it
    receives on the command line). We will be using the SOCK_SEQPACKET socket type, which provides a reliable message-oriented
    stream. Note that unlike Project 2, you do not need to pad the name of the domain sockets with \0.
</p>
<p>
    Exactly how to connect to a UNIX domain socket depends on your programming language. For example, if you were using perl
    to complete the project, your code for connecting would look like:
    <pre>use IO::Socket::UNIX;
my $lan = IO::Socket::UNIX->new(
    Type => SOCK_SEQPACKET,
    Peer => "&lt;lan&gt;"
);</pre>
    You can then read and write from the $lan variable. In python, your code would look like
    <pre>from socket import socket, SOCK_SEQPACKET, AF_UNIX
s = socket (AF_UNIX, SOCK_SEQPACKET)
s.connect ('&lt;lan&gt;')</pre>
    with similar results.
</p>
<p>
    We encourage you to write your code in an event-driven style using select() or poll(). This will keep your code single-threaded
    and will make debugging your code significantly easier. Alternatively, you can implement your datastore in a threaded
    model, but expect it to be significantly more difficult to debug.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Datastore Requirements and Assumptions</h3>
    The goal of your system is to accept put()s from clients and retrieve the corresponding data when a get() is issued. To ensure
    that data is not lost when a process crashes, all data from clients must be replicated, which then raises the dueling
    issues of how to maintain consistency and achieve high-availability. To meet these goals, your datastore will implement
    the Raft consensus protocol. Ultimately, your datastore should achieve the following two goals:
    <ol>
        <li>Consistency - clients should always receive correct answers to get() requests.</li>
        <li>Availability - clients should be able to execute put() and get() requests at any time with low latency (i.e. your
            system should execute requests quickly).</li>
    </ol>
    Raft is a complicated protocol, and real-world datastores are extremely complicated artifacts. To simplify this project,
    there are several things you <b>do not need to implement</b>:
    <ul>
        <li>True persistence - you do not need to write client updates to disk, or worry about committing data to permanent storage.
            All of the data from clients and the log of updates can live in memory.</li>
        <li>Garbage collection - Raft maintains a log of all updates. In a real system, this log periodically needs to be garbage
            collected, since it cannot grow infinitely long. However, your system will not be running for long periods of
            time, and therefor you do not need to worry about garbage collection.</li>
        <li>Restarts - in a real system, replicas might fail for a while then come back online, necessitating snapshots and reconciliation.
            However, you may assume that replicas in the simulator will crash fail, i.e. they will die completely and never
            return.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Implementing Raft</h3>
    The <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">Raft paper</a> is specifically designed to be easy to read. To implement
    the protocol you should definitely start by reading the paper. Additional papers and resources are available on the
    <a
        href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft Github</a>. I would suggest the following series of steps to begin working on your datastore implementation:
        <ol>
            <li>Add basic support for responding to client get() and put() requests. At this point, you can respond to all requests
                with a "type": "fail" message.</li>
            <li>Implement the Raft election protocol (section 5.2 of the Raft paper); add the ability to respond to get() and
                put() requests with "type": "redirect" messages.</li>
            <li>Add a timeout to detect leader failures (i.e. if you don't hear from the leader in X milliseconds...) and make
                sure that the new election proceeds correctly.</li>
            <li>Implement a basic, empty version of the AppendEntries RPC call that doesn't replicate any data, but acts as a
                keepalive message from the leader to other replicas to prevent unnecessary elections.</li>
            <li>Implement the transaction log and the "state machine" (i.e. a dictionary containing the key/value pairs from
                clients, Section 5.3). Don't bother replicating the transactions, just ensure that the leader is able to
                correctly answer get() and put() requests.</li>
            <li>Improve your AppendEntries RPC call to actually send data to replicas. Ensure that updates are only committing
                when a quorum is in agreement.</li>
            <li>Add support for retrying failed commits and test it by experimenting with lossy network simulations.</li>
            <li>If you haven't already, modify the leader election to support the additional restrictions in Section 5.4.1; test
                your implementation on lossy networks with failed leaders.</li>
            <li>Implement the subtle commit restriction given in Section 5.4.2.</li>
            <li>Improve your AppendEntries RPC call to implement batching, i.e. a single AppendEntries may send multiple 
                outstanding log entries to a given replica.</li>
            <li>Test, test, test, and test some more ;)</li>
        </ol>
        Step 6 will probably require the most time in terms of writing code and debugging, since it is the crux of the algorithm.
        Implementing steps 7-10 are necessary to ensure correctness of the protocol, but shouldn't be too difficult.
